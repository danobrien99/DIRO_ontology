# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

## How to contribute
We welcome contributions to improve the DIRO ontology, attributes, relationships, examples, and documentation.

### Workflow
1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub (or Git) account.
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main` for your change.
3. **Make your edits** with clear commit messages.
4. **Open a pull request (PR)** back to this repository.

### Requesting a push
If you are a member of the core team and need direct write access, request a push by contacting the maintainers.

Otherwise, use the fork-and-PR workflow above.

### What happens next
- Maintainers review PRs for clarity, correctness, and consistency.
- You may be asked to revise or clarify changes.
- Once approved, changes are merged and released as part of the next update.

### Tips for ontology contributions
- Keep changes focused and well-described.
- Include examples when adding new terms or relationships.
- Update documentation and shapes (if relevant) alongside ontology changes.
